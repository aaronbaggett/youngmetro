## Overview 🏙️

The **youngmetro** package is a semi-custom beamer theme for use in
RStudio via R Markdown. This theme borrows heavily from the
[HSRM](https://github.com/benjamin-weiss/hsrmbeamertheme),
[sthlm](https://github.com/markolsonse/sthlmBeamerTheme), and
[Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) Beamer themes.

## Installation 🔌

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE) 
}
devtools::install_github("aaronbaggett/youngmetro")
```

## Usage 💻

### RStudio

The `youngmetro` theme is designed to be used primarily within RStudio.
Once installed, select *File* \> *New File* \> *R Markdown* \> *From
Template* \> `youngmetro`. After naming and selecting a location for
your prestnation, a new R Markdown document will open in the Source
pane. This document contains some basic information that you will want
to update (see **Front Matter**
below).

### R

The following should work if you would like to use `youngmetro` outside
of
RStudio:

``` r
rmarkdown::draft("slide_deck.Rmd", template = "metro_beamer", package = "youngmetro")

rmarkdown::render("slide_deck.Rmd")
```

### Front Matter

The Pandoc YAML is pre-populated with the following:

``` yaml
---
title: "Presentation Title"
shorttitle: "Short Title"
subtitle: "Presentation Subtitle"
author: "Aaron R. Baggett, Ph.D."
short-author: "Baggett"
date: '`r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`'
short-date: '`r format(Sys.Date(), "%m/%d/%y")`'
institute: | 
  | University of Mary Hardin-Baylor
  | PSYC 431XXXXxpCOURSE TITLEort-institute: "PSYC XXXX"
department: "Department of Psychology" # Institute must be defined
mainfont: Roboto
monofont: Lucida Console
fontsize: 14pt
classoption: aspectratio = 1610
output: 
   youngmetro::metro_beamer
---
```

### Title Graphic

I designed this slide deck to pretty much serve myself. I wanted an easy
way to generate custom .Rmd Beamer slides for my classes. That said, you
probably want to swap out the example image for your own university’s
logo. Until I come up with a better solution, you will need to do the
following:

1.  Rename your title graphic to `title_graphic`
2.  Place *your* `title_graphic` in the `figs` folder
3.  Accept replacement warning

That should do the trick.

### Figures

Place all figures in the `figs` folder and refer directly to the
filename with no directory mapping required. For example:

``` r
\includegraphics{file_name.EXT}
```

### XeLaTeX

`youngmetro` uses XeLaTeX as the default TeX typesetting engine. Just
comment out the `mainfont:` and `monofont` options in the front matter.
This should revert back to Pandoc’s defaults.

``` yaml
---
# mainfont: Roboto
# monofont: Lucida Console
---
```

Note: Roboto can be downloaded free from Google Fonts
[here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

### Emoji

There’s not really an easy way to add emoji to pdf LaTeX documents 😡.
Most packages require including emoji as essentially .png or .pdf files
🤕. Unfortunately, at the moment, the
[`emo`](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package does not provide
functionality for pdf documents. One alternative would be to use one of
several [emoji
extractors](https://github.com/rinatkhanov/emoji-extractor). Even still,
you are forced to include emoji as an image. One problem with this
method is that, althogh the emoji images are fairly high-resolution,
they are named in sequential order. In other words, the Unicode
characters are lost in the file names, which makes it difficult to
search for the emoji you want.
